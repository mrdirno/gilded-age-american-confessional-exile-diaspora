  "cover_prompt": "A solitary woman in a tattered but once-opulent ballgown stands on a fog-draped European pier, her back to the viewer, gazing at the silhouette of a departing transatlantic steamship, the architectural ghost of her old life fading into the mist, clutching a small, heavy ledger that holds the accounts of traded social secrets. The scene is set in a liminal space between the industrial pier and the opulent, blurred lights of a distant port city, with details of chipped gilt on a lamppost and pearls scattered like forgotten currency on damp cobblestones, evoking the themes of exile and fragile performance. In the atmospheric style of Vilhelm Hammershøi's muted interiors and Edward Hopper's cinematic loneliness, combined with the textural richness of John Singer Sargent's portraiture. Book cover framing, centered and intimate yet vast composition, a dramatic low-angle shot that makes the figure both vulnerable and monumental, with the vast, empty sky and sea dominating the upper half. Chiaroscuro lighting with a single, cold source from a pier lantern, casting long, defining shadows, using a color palette of tarnished gold, deep charcoal, sea-foam grey, and the faintest blush of a lost rose on her gown. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
